'''
A nice way to visualize the variability we might expect in a linear regression is to plot the line you would get from each bootstrap replicate of the slope and intercept. Do this for the first 100 of your bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept (stored as bs_slope_reps and bs_intercept_reps).
'''
# Generate array of x-values for bootstrap lines: x
x = np.array([0, 100])

# Plot the bootstrap lines
for i in range(100):
    _ = plt.plot(x, bs_slope_reps[i]*x + bs_intercept_reps[i],
                 linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, color='red')

# Plot the data
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy, fertility, marker='.', linestyle='none')

# Label axes, set the margins, and show the plot
_ = plt.xlabel('illiteracy')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.show()
