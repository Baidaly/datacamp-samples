Cumulative statistics can also be helpful in tracking summary statistics over time. In this exercise, you'll calculate the cumulative sum and cumulative max of a department's weekly sales, which will allow you to identify what the total sales were so far as well as what the highest weekly sales were so far.

# Sort sales_1_1 by date
sales_1_1 = sales_1_1.sort_values("date", ascending=True)

# Get the cumulative sum of weekly_sales, add as cum_weekly_sales col
sales_1_1["cum_weekly_sales"] = sales_1_1["weekly_sales"].cumsum()

# Get the cumulative max of weekly_sales, add as cum_max_sales col
sales_1_1["cum_max_sales"] = sales_1_1["weekly_sales"].cummax()

# See the columns you calculated
print(sales_1_1[["date", "weekly_sales", "cum_weekly_sales", "cum_max_sales"]])
