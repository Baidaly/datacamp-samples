'''
Image data comes in many forms and it is not always appropriate to display the available channels in RGB space. In many situations, an image may be processed and analysed in some way before it is visualized in pseudocolor, also known as 'false' color.

In this exercise, you will perform a simple analysis using the image showing an astronaut as viewed from space. Instead of simply displaying the image, you will compute the total intensity across the red, green and blue channels. The result is a single two dimensional array which you will display using plt.imshow() with the 'gray' colormap.

# Load the image into an array: img
img = plt.imread('480px-Astronaut-EVA.jpg')

# Print the shape of the image
print(img.shape)

# Compute the sum of the red, green and blue channels: intensity
intensity = img.sum(axis=2)

# Print the shape of the intensity
print(intensity.shape)

# Display the intensity with a colormap of 'gray'
plt.imshow(intensity, cmap='gray')

# Add a colorbar
plt.colorbar()

# Hide the axes and show the figure
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
