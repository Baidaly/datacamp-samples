'''
In this exercise, you'll compare the historical 10-year GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth in the US and in China. The data for the US starts in 1947 and is recorded quarterly; by contrast, the data for China starts in 1961 and is recorded annually.

You'll need to use a combination of resampling and an inner join to align the index labels. You'll need an appropriate offset alias for resampling, and the method .resample() must be chained with some kind of aggregation method (.pct_change() and .last() in this case).

pandas has been imported as pd, and the DataFrames china and us have been pre-loaded, with the output of china.head() and us.head() printed in the IPython Shell.

# Resample and tidy china: china_annual
china_annual = china.resample('A').pct_change(10).dropna()

# Resample and tidy us: us_annual
us_annual = us.resample('A').pct_change(10).dropna()

# Concatenate china_annual and us_annual: gdp
gdp = pd.concat([china_annual, us_annual], join='inner', axis=1)

# Resample gdp and print
print(gdp.resample('10A').last())
