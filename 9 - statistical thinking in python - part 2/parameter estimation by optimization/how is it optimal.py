'''
The function np.polyfit() that you used to get your regression parameters finds the optimal slope and intercept. It is optimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, also known as RSS (for residual sum of squares). In this exercise, you will plot the function that is being optimized, the RSS, versus the slope parameter a. To do this, fix the intercept to be what you found in the optimization. Then, plot the RSS vs. the slope. Where is it minimal?

# Specify slopes to consider: a_vals
a_vals = np.linspace(0, 0.1, 200)

# Initialize sum of square of residuals: rss
rss = np.empty_like(a_vals)

# Compute sum of square of residuals for each value of a_vals
for i, a in enumerate(a_vals):
    rss[i] = np.sum((fertility - a*illiteracy - b)**2)

# Plot the RSS
plt.plot(a_vals, rss, '-')
plt.xlabel('slope (children per woman / percent illiterate)')
plt.ylabel('sum of square of residuals')

plt.show()
