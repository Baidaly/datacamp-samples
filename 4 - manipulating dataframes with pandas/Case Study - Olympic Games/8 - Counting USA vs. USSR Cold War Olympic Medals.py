'''
For this exercise, you want to see which country, the USA or the USSR, won the most medals consistently over the Cold War period.

There are several steps involved in carrying out this computation.

    You'll need a pivot table with years ('Edition') on the index and countries ('NOC') on the columns. The entries will be the total number of medals each country won that year. If the country won no medals in a given edition, expect a NaN in that entry of the pivot table.
    You'll need to slice the Cold War period and subset the 'USA' and 'URS' columns.
    You'll need to make a Series from this slice of the pivot table that tells which country won the most medals in that edition using .idxmax(axis='columns'). If .max() returns the maximum value of Series or 1D array, .idxmax() returns the index of the maximizing element. The argument axis=columns or axis=1 is required because, by default, this aggregation would be done along columns for a DataFrame.
    The final Series contains either 'USA' or 'URS' according to which country won the most medals in each Olympic edition. You can use .value_counts() to count the number of occurrences of each.

# Create the pivot table: medals_won_by_country
medals_won_by_country = medals.pivot_table(index='Edition', columns='NOC', values='Athlete', aggfunc='count')

# Slice medals_won_by_country: cold_war_usa_urs_medals
cold_war_usa_urs_medals = medals_won_by_country.loc[1952:1988, ['USA','URS']]

# Create most_medals 
most_medals = cold_war_usa_urs_medals.idxmax(axis='columns')

# Print most_medals.value_counts()
print(most_medals.value_counts())
