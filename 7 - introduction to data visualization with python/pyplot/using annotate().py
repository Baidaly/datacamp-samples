'''
It is often useful to annotate a simple plot to provide context. This makes the plot more readable and can highlight specific aspects of the data. Annotations like text and arrows can be used to emphasize specific observations.

Here, you will once again plot enrollment of women in the Physical Sciences and Computer science over time. The legend is set up as before. Additionally, you will mark the inflection point when enrollment of women in Computer Science reached a peak and started declining using plt.annotate().

To enable an arrow, set arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black'). The arrow will point to the location given by xy and the text will appear at the location given by xytext.

# Plot with legend as before
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red', label='Computer Science') 
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue', label='Physical Sciences')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')

# Compute the maximum enrollment of women in Computer Science: cs_max
cs_max = computer_science.max()

# Calculate the year in which there was maximum enrollment of women in Computer Science: yr_max
yr_max = year[computer_science.argmax()]

# Add a black arrow annotation
arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black')

plt.annotate('Maximum', xy=(yr_max, cs_max), xytext=(yr_max + 5, cs_max + 5), arrowprops = arrowprops)

# Add axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Enrollment (%)')
plt.title('Undergraduate enrollment of women')
plt.show()
