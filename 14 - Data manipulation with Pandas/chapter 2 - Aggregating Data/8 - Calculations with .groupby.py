'''
The .groupby() method makes life much easier. In this exercise, you'll perform the same calculations as last time, except you'll use the .groupby() method. You'll also perform calculations on data grouped by two variables to see if sales differs by store type depending on if it's a holiday week or not.

# From previous step
sales_by_type = sales.groupby("type")["weekly_sales"].sum()

# Group by type and is_holiday; calc total weekly sales
sales_by_type_is_holiday = sales.groupby(["type", "is_holiday"])["weekly_sales"].sum()
print(sales_by_type_is_holiday)
