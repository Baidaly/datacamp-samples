'''
Similar to pd.merge_ordered(), the pd.merge_asof() function will also merge values in order using the on column, but for each row in the left DataFrame, only rows from the right DataFrame whose 'on' column values are less than the left value will be kept.

This function can be used to align disparate datetime frequencies without having to first resample.

Here, you'll merge monthly oil prices (US dollars) into a full automobile fuel efficiency dataset. The oil and automobile DataFrames have been pre-loaded as oil and auto. The first 5 rows of each have been printed in the IPython Shell for you to explore.

These datasets will align such that the first price of the year will be broadcast into the rows of the automobiles DataFrame. This is considered correct since by the start of any given year, most automobiles for that year will have already been manufactured.

You'll then inspect the merged DataFrame, resample by year and compute the mean 'Price' and 'mpg'. You should be able to see a trend in these two columns, that you can confirm by computing the Pearson correlation between resampled 'Price' and 'mpg'.

# Print the tail of merged
