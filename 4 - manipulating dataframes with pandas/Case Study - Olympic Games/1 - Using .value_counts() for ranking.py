'''
For this exercise, you will use the pandas Series method .value_counts() to determine the top 15 countries ranked by total number of medals.

Notice that .value_counts() sorts by values by default. The result is returned as a Series of counts indexed by unique entries from the original Series with values (counts) ranked in descending order.

The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as medals.
'''
# Select the 'NOC' column of medals: country_names
country_names = medals['NOC']

# Count the number of medals won by each country: medal_counts
medal_counts = country_names.value_counts()

# Print top 15 countries ranked by medals
print(medal_counts.head(15))
