'''
The heritability of beak depth in G. scandens seems low. It could be that this observed heritability was just achieved by chance and beak depth is actually not really heritable in the species. You will test that hypothesis here. To do this, you will do a pairs permutation test.

# Initialize array of replicates: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)

# Draw replicates
for i in range(10000):

    bd_parent_permuted = np.random.permutation(bd_parent_scandens)
    perm_replicates[i] = heritability(bd_parent_permuted, bd_offspring_scandens)


# Compute p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= heritability_scandens) / len(perm_replicates)

# Print the p-value
print('p-val =', p)
