'''
Estimate the difference of the mean beak depth of the G. scandens samples from 1975 and 2012 and report a 95% confidence interval.

Since in this exercise you will use the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2, it may be helpful to refer back to it.

# Compute the difference of the sample means: mean_diff
