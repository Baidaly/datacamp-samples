Cleaning and tidying datetime data

In order to use the full power of pandas time series, you must construct a DatetimeIndex. To do so, it is necessary to clean and transform the date and time columns.

The DataFrame df_dropped you created in the last exercise is provided for you and pandas has been imported as pd.

Your job is to clean up the date and Time columns and combine them into a datetime collection to be used as the Index.
