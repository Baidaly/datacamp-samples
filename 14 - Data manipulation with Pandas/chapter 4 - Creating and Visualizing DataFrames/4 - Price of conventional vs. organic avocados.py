'''
Creating multiple plots for different subsets of data allows you to compare groups. In this exercise, you'll create multiple histograms to compare the prices of conventional and organic avocados.

matplotlib.pyplot has been imported as plt and pandas has been imported as pd.

# Modify bins to 20
avocados[avocados["type"] == "conventional"]["avg_price"].hist(alpha=0.5, bins=20)

# Modify bins to 20
avocados[avocados["type"] == "organic"]["avg_price"].hist(alpha=0.5, bins=20)

# Add a legend
plt.legend(["conventional", "organic"])

# Show the plot
plt.show()
