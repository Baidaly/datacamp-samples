'''
The function bootstrap_replicate_1d() from the video is available in your namespace. Now you'll write another function, draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1), which generates many bootstrap replicates from the data set. This function will come in handy for you again and again as you compute confidence intervals and later when you do hypothesis tests.

For your reference, the bootstrap_replicate_1d() function is provided below:

def bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func):
    return func(np.random.choice(data, size=len(data)))

'''
def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    """Draw bootstrap replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: bs_replicates
    bs_replicates = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_replicates[i] = bootstrap_replicate_1d(data, func)

    return bs_replicates
